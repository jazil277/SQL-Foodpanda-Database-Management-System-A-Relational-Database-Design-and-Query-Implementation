## SQL-Foodpanda-Database-Management-System-A-Relational-Database-Design-and-Query-Implementation

# Project Description

This project involved designing and implementing a relational database for the food delivery company, Foodpanda. The database simulates the company's operations, including managing customers, orders, payments, promotions, food items, and restaurants. The objectives were to design an efficient database schema and implement SQL queries to handle various business scenarios such as tracking orders, payments, and managing food baskets. The project emphasized understanding key database concepts such as relationships, joins, subqueries, and data validation through constraints.

# Objectives

- Design a relational database schema for Foodpanda.

- Implement SQL queries to manage customer orders, payments, food items, promotions, and riders.

- Establish relationships such as one-to-many and many-to-many.

- Ensure data integrity with constraint checks and referential actions like ON DELETE CASCADE.

- Demonstrate advanced SQL operations like joins, subqueries, and group-by clauses.

# Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL: For creating and managing the database.

- SQL: For executing queries and performing database operations.

# How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.

2. Import the SQL script files into PostgreSQL.

3. Run the scripts to recreate the database schema.

4. Use SQL queries provided to interact with the database and retrieve desired results.

5. This will set up the Foodpanda database and allow you to test the relationships and queries designed for the project.
